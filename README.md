mufit
=====

mufit is a Matlab program written in order to analyze noisy data measured by a turbidostat
The interactive user interface allows the user to

 - import data from excel files

 - modify the automatically determined parameters of the data

 - filter out noisy segments of the data
 
 - choose fitting model (Brownian motion, integrated Brownian motion)
 
 - fit the growth rate to the entire dataset with a Bayesian algorithm
 
 - export the results into an excel file
